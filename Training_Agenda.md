## Agenda

TimeSession Title & Description09:30 – 10:15Kickoff & Azure Cosmos DB Overview
Introduction to Cosmos DB’s architecture, global distribution, multi-model APIs (SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table), and consistency models. Use cases in real-time analytics, IoT, and AI.| **10:15 – 11:15** | **Hands-on Lab 1: Environment Setup**<br>Provision Cosmos DB accounts, configure indexing and partitioning, install SDKs (Node.js, .NET, Python), and validate access. |
| **11:15 – 12:00** | **Data Modelling & Optimisation**<br>Deep dive into indexing policies, partitioning strategies, schema design, and query tuning. Learn to model for access patterns and avoid common anti-patterns. |
| **12:00 – 01:00** | **Hands-on Lab 2: Data Modelling & Querying**<br>Design partitioned data models, write SQL queries, and analyse RU consumption. Use diagnostic logs to identify performance bottlenecks. |
| **01:00 – 01:30** | 🍽️ **Lunch Break** |
| **01:30 – 02:15** | **Developing AI Agents with Azure Cosmos DB**<br>Explore how to implement AI Agents, including Full Text Search, Vector Search, Hybrid Search using Azure Cosmos DB. Learn hybrid search patterns and use cases. |
| **02:15 – 03:15** | **Hands-on Lab 3: AI-Powered Search**<br>Build AI Agent based on Azure Cosmos DB, vectorise the data, create vector indexes, perform full text, vector and hybrid queries with & without filters. Also optimise the search, and evaluate the data modelling techniques with it. |
| **03:15 – 04:00** | **Security & Cost Optimisation**<br>Understand RBAC, private endpoints, encryption, and cost-saving strategies like autoscale, TTL, and indexing tuning. |
| **04:00 – 05:00** | **Hands-on Lab 4: Try out Security & Cost Optimisation techniques**<br>Apply cost-saving techniques in a live Cosmos DB environment. Use diagnostic tools to monitor RU usage, simulate autoscale, and optimise indexing policies. |
| **05:00 – 05:15** | **Latest Updates in Azure Cosmos DB + Wrap-up**<br>Explore recent feature releases (burst capacity, hierarchical partitioning, integrated vector indexing), recap key learnings, and open Q&A. |
