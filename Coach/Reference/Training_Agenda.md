## Agenda

| Time           | Session Title & Description | Presentation
|----------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **09:30 – 10:15** | **Kickoff & Azure Cosmos DB Overview**<br>Introduction to Cosmos DB’s architecture, global distribution, consistency model, use cases, AI, Full Text Search & Hybrid Search. Use cases in real-time analytics, IoT, and AI. |[Kickoff & Azure Cosmos DB Overview](Presentations/CosmosDBForAI.pptx)|
| **10:15 – 11:00** | **Hands-on Lab 1: Environment Setup**<br>Provision Cosmos DB accounts, configure indexing and partitioning, install SDKs (Node.js, .NET, Python), and validate access. |
| **11:00 – 12:30** | **Data Modelling & Optimisation**<br>Deep dive into indexing policies, partitioning strategies, schema design, and query tuning. Learn to model for access patterns and avoid common anti-patterns. |[Cosmos DB Data Modeling & Optimization](Presentations/Cosmos%20DB%20Data%20Modeling%20&%20Optimization.pptx)|
| **12:30 – 01:00** | **Hands-on Lab 2: Data Modelling & Querying**<br>Design partitioned data models, write SQL queries, and analyse RU consumption. Use diagnostic logs to identify performance bottlenecks. |
| **01:00 – 01:30** | 🍽️ **Lunch Break** |
| **01:30 – 02:15** | **Developing AI Agents with Azure Cosmos DB**<br>Explore how to implement AI Agents, including Full Text Search, Vector Search, Hybrid Search using Azure Cosmos DB. Learn hybrid search patterns and use cases. |[Cosmos DB for AI](Presentations/CosmosDBForAI.pptx)|
| **02:15 – 03:15** | **Hands-on Lab 3: AI-Powered Search**<br>Build AI Agent based on Azure Cosmos DB, vectorise the data, create vector indexes, perform full text, vector and hybrid queries with & without filters. Also optimise the search, and evaluate the data modelling techniques with it. |
| **03:15 – 04:00** | **Security & Cost Optimisation**<br>Understand RBAC, private endpoints, encryption, and cost-saving strategies like autoscale, TTL, and indexing tuning. |[Azure CosmosDB Security](Presentations/Azure%20CosmosDB%20Security.pptx)|
| **04:00 – 05:00** | **Hands-on Lab 4: Try out Security & Cost Optimisation techniques**<br>Apply cost-saving techniques in a live Cosmos DB environment. Use diagnostic tools to monitor RU usage, simulate autoscale, and optimise indexing policies. |
| **05:00 – 05:15** | **Latest Updates in Azure Cosmos DB + Wrap-up**<br>Explore recent feature releases (burst capacity, hierarchical partitioning, integrated vector indexing), recap key learnings, and open Q&A. |
