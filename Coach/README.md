# What The Hack - Azure Cosmos DB for AI & Modern Applications - Coach Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the coach's guide for Azure Cosmos DB for AI & Modern Applications. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

This hack includes optional lecture presentations that feature short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.

**NOTE:** If you are a Hackathon participant, this is the answer guide. Don't cheat yourself by looking at these during the hack! Go learn something. :)

## Suggested Hack Agenda

Join us for a full-day Azure Cosmos DB Hands-on Workshop designed to equip you with the skills to build scalable, high-performance, and cost-optimised applications. This workshop blends technical deep dives with guided labs covering data modelling, full text and vector search, and real-world cost optimisation strategies. You'll also explore the latest innovations in Cosmos DB, including its integration with Microsoft Fabric. Ideal for developers, architects, and data professionals looking to deepen their expertise with Cosmos DB.

## Coach Notes

### General Guidance

- Encourage students to work in teams of 3-5 people
- Each challenge builds on the previous one - ensure teams complete challenges in order
- Monitor Azure costs during the hack and help students clean up resources
- Be prepared to help with Azure OpenAI quota issues
- Have backup Azure subscriptions available if needed

### Common Challenges

1. **Azure OpenAI Access**: Some students may not have immediate access. Help them request access or provide temporary shared resources.

2. **Quota Limitations**: Azure OpenAI quota can be a bottleneck. Monitor usage and help students optimize their requests.

3. **Data Modeling Concepts**: Students may struggle with NoSQL thinking. Be ready to provide guidance on denormalization and embedding vs. referencing.

4. **Vector Search Understanding**: The concept of embeddings and similarity search may be new. Use analogies and visual explanations.

5. **Cost Optimization**: Help students understand the difference between provisioned and serverless throughput models.

### Key Teaching Points

- Emphasize the importance of understanding your data access patterns before designing your model
- Highlight the difference between RDBMS and NoSQL design approaches
- Explain how partition key choice affects performance and cost
- Demonstrate the power of combining different search types (full-text, vector, hybrid)
- Show real-world cost optimization techniques that can save significant money
